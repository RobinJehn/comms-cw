test_nat.py â€“ A test harness to exercise the marking criteria:

1. Mediation of a TCP connection (flow installation)
2. Reuse of a client TCP port from an expired NAT table entry
3. Sending a TCP RST when the NAT table is full
4. Support for many simultaneous connections

Before running, make sure your NAT controller (nat.py) is running via:
    osken-manager nat.py

And that your Mininet VM has the Python Mininet API installed.

Usage:
    sudo python3 test_nat.py
